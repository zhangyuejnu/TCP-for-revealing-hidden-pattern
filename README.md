# TCP-for-revealing-hidden-pattern
The script is coded in Matlab 2014. Its aim is to reorgnize the samples such that similar ones are rearranged together thus to view a pattern stucture. It includes:

1 permu_TVL1_Secular_2D_v2: the main function of TCP

2 example_4blocks: A synthetic example to illustrate the power of TCP in recovering block patterns under various noises degradations.

3 exp_FS_permute: A synthetic example to illustrate the immulization of TCP over noisy feature perterbations. 

4 figure3_draw.m: An emprical experiment by using 100 raw single sequencing data named nbReal1Finnal and 100 single sequencing data after clustering  using TCP method named results4SRC3_city_a_1000g_5.  There are three resulted figures, including raw dataset of Read Depth of heatmap, dataset after clustering using TCP model of Read Depth of heatmap and the result of hierarchical cluster analysis of Read Depth of 100 raw dataset.
